Child: Mom! You are writing about nutrition, right?  
Me, peeling chunks of destroyed waffle off the griddle, second guessing myself: Mmmhmmm…  
Child: Great! You are so great at cooking.  
Me: You do see this?  
Child: Yeah. We love waffle mountain.

You know what? Life ain’t pretty sometimes. And I fail to make actual waffle-shaped-waffles almost every single time. It’s probably a combination of my dislike of following recipes, oil, and an old griddle.

No need to be or have a sous chef to fill growing bellies with food to stabilize and encourage optimal mental growth. You can do it with a waffle mountain.

I was taught in a high school art class that we can claim our mistakes in light of necessitated creativity and make them a part of the full creation.

So behold, waffle mountain. A regular adventure in our house. I could see failure, but we make it fun.

Reframing can make all the difference: Green muffins? Hulk Muffins. Broken waffles? Waffle mountain.
